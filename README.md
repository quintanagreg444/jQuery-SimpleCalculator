<h1><strong>jQuery-SimpleCalculator</strong></h1>

I am currently working self paced on this jQuery calculator to catch up. This will be one hour of my dedicated time per night until it is done. 

I have written out steps on paper that I feel are logical it will be interesting to see how my psuedo coding and hard coding grows with the practice. 

Feel free to leave feedback or even help me if you feel inclined to do so :) 

Thank you very much.
